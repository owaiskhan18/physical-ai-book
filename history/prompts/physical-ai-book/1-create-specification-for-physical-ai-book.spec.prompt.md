## Prompt

Based on the constitution, create a detailed specification for the Physical AI book. Include the following:

1. Book Structure – 1 chapter with 3 lessons each, including titles and detailed descriptions.  
2. Content Guidelines – specify tone, style, and instructional approach.  
3. Lesson Format – outline structure, hands-on activities, examples, and exercises.  
4. Docusaurus-Specific Requirements – define organization, navigation, and formatting for documentation.  

Ensure the content is comprehensive, detailed, and ready for practical implementation.

## Response snapshot

Of course. Based on the constitution, I will create a detailed specification for the Physical AI book.

I will create the new specification in a new directory and file: `specs/physical-ai-book/spec.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Defined the detailed structure, content guidelines, and technical requirements for the Physical AI book.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this documentation task.
- 📁 Files: Created 1 new file: specs/physical-ai-book/spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now create a plan or tasks based on the new specification.
- 🧠 Reflection: The specification translates the high-level constitution into a concrete, actionable blueprint for content creation. This step is crucial for ensuring alignment before implementation begins.
