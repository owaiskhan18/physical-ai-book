## Prompt

Create a comprehensive development plan for building the Physical AI book in Docusaurus. Include the following:

1. Docusaurus Setup – detailed steps for installation, configuration, and initialization.  
2. Content Development Phases – outline stages from planning to writing, reviewing, and finalizing content.  
3. File Structure – define organization for chapters, lessons, and supporting assets.  

Ensure the plan is thorough, detailed, and actionable for building the book efficiently.

## Response snapshot

Understood. I will now create a comprehensive development plan based on the constitution and specification documents. This plan will detail the Docusaurus setup, content development workflow, and the complete file structure for the book.

The plan will be saved to `specs/physical-ai-book/plan.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed development plan for setting up Docusaurus and establishing a content creation workflow.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this planning task.
- 📁 Files: Created 1 new file: specs/physical-ai-book/plan.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now approve the plan and move to the implementation/task creation stage.
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan provides a solid, actionable foundation for building the project. Suggesting an ADR for the structural decisions was an important step.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
