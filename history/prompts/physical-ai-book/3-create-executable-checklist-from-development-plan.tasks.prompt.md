## Prompt

Break down the development plan into a detailed, executable checklist. Include:

1. Docusaurus Setup Tasks – all steps required for installation, configuration, and initialization.  
2. Chapter Development Tasks – specific tasks for 1 chapter with 3 lessons, including writing, reviewing, formatting, and organizing content.  

Ensure the checklist is comprehensive, step-by-step, and ready for practical execution.

## Response snapshot

Of course. I will break down the development plan into a detailed and executable checklist.

This checklist will be saved as a new file: `specs/physical-ai-book/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Converted the high-level development plan into a granular, step-by-step checklist for execution.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this planning task.
- 📁 Files: Created 1 new file: specs/physical-ai-book/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now begin executing the tasks in the checklist, starting with the Docusaurus setup.
- 🧠 Reflection: This moves the project from planning to a state of execution-readiness. The checklist format makes the work concrete and trackable.
