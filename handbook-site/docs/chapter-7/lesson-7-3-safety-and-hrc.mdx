# 7.3 - Safety & HRC (Human-Robot Collaboration)

## What You'll Learn

As robots move out of cages and into human environments, safety becomes paramount. This lesson delves into the crucial topics of robotic safety standards and the principles of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). You will understand how to design and operate robots that are not only effective but also safe and cooperative when interacting with people.

## 1. Robotic Safety Standards

Safety in robotics is not optional; it's a fundamental requirement, often mandated by law and industry standards. These standards provide guidelines for design, manufacturing, and operation to minimize risks.

### a. Risk Assessment

-   **Concept:** The foundational step in safety. It involves systematically identifying potential hazards associated with a robot, estimating the likelihood and severity of harm, and determining if risk reduction measures are needed.
-   **Hazards:** Mechanical (crushing, cutting), Electrical (shock, fire), Thermal (burns), Noise, Ergonomic (repetitive strain).

### b. Emergency Stops (E-Stops)

-   **Purpose:** To bring a robot to a safe, controlled stop as quickly as possible in an emergency situation.
-   **Characteristics:**
    -   **Readily Accessible:** Clearly marked and easy to reach.
    -   **Latching:** Once pressed, it stays engaged until manually reset.
    -   **Redundancy:** Often involves multiple E-stops and independent safety circuits.
    -   **Fail-Safe Design:** Should operate even if power to the control system is lost.

### c. Common Industrial Safety Standards

-   **ISO 10218 (Robots and Robotic Devices - Safety Requirements for Industrial Robots):**
    -   **Part 1 (Robots):** Specifies requirements for the design and construction of industrial robots.
    -   **Part 2 (Robot Systems and Integration):** Specifies requirements for the installation, operation, maintenance, and safeguarding of industrial robot systems.
-   **ISO/TS 15066 (Collaborative Robots):**
    -   A technical specification that supplements ISO 10218-1 and -2, specifically addressing collaborative industrial robot applications. It defines the principles of Human-Robot Collaboration.

## 2. Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)

HRC refers to scenarios where humans and robots work together, often sharing a common workspace, to achieve a task. This requires specialized safety considerations beyond traditional caged industrial robots.

### a. HRC Operating Modes (as per ISO/TS 15066)

1.  **Safety-Rated Monitored Stop:** The robot stops when a human enters the collaborative workspace and can restart automatically when the human leaves.
2.  **Hand Guiding:** The human directly guides the robot by physically moving it, often used for teaching or precise positioning.
3.  **Speed and Separation Monitoring:** The robot's speed is reduced as a human approaches and stops completely if separation distances are breached.
4.  **Power and Force Limiting:** The robot is designed such that contact forces and pressures are inherently limited to avoid injury to a human. This is often the most sophisticated and safest mode.

### b. Principles for Safe HRC Design

-   **Predictability:** Robots should move in predictable ways. Avoid sudden, erratic, or ambiguous motions.
-   **Transparency:** The robot's intent and current state should be easily understandable by humans (e.g., through lights, displays, sounds).
-   **Awareness:** Robots must continuously monitor their workspace for human presence and react appropriately.
-   **Responsiveness:** Robots should respond quickly and safely to human commands or interventions.
-   **Compliance:** Designing robots with some mechanical compliance (spring-like behavior) or impedance control to make physical contact safer.

## 3. Fault Detection & Handling

Even with the best design, faults can occur. A robust system needs to detect and handle these gracefully.

### a. Sensors for Monitoring

-   **Internal Sensors:** Monitor motor currents, joint temperatures, voltage levels, controller states.
-   **External Safety Sensors:** Light curtains, safety laser scanners, pressure-sensitive mats, vision-based human detection systems.

### b. Defining and Reacting to Error States

-   **Error Taxonomy:** Clearly define different error levels (e.g., Warning, Minor Error, Critical Error) and the required robot response for each.
-   **Safe State:** When an error occurs, the robot should transition to a defined safe state (e.g., motors disabled, brakes engaged, gripper opened).
-   **Graceful Degradation:** In non-critical failures, can the robot continue operating with reduced functionality, or does it need to stop completely?

### c. Software Watchdogs and Heartbeats

-   **Watchdog Timers:** Hardware or software timers that, if not reset periodically, will trigger a system reset or safe shutdown, preventing the robot from getting stuck in an unresponsive state.
-   **Heartbeats:** Nodes periodically publish a "heartbeat" message to indicate they are alive. A supervisor node can detect missing heartbeats and take action.

## Hands-On (Discussion: Capstone Safety Plan)

Let's consider the safety implications of our capstone mobile manipulator performing a pick-and-place task.

### Step 1: Identify Potential Hazards

-   **Mobile Base:** What if it collides with a human or another object? What if it tips over?
-   **Manipulator Arm:** What if it strikes a human? What if it drops the object?
-   **Grasping:** What if a human's hand is in the gripper's path?
-   **Electrical:** Are there exposed wires? What if a battery short-circuits?

### Step 2: Propose Safety Measures

Based on the hazards, what safety measures would you implement for the simulated (and eventually real) capstone robot?

-   **Software Safety:**
    -   Collision detection in navigation (Nav2).
    -   Joint limits for the arm.
    -   Safe arm trajectories (collision-free).
    -   Object detection to prevent grasping human hands.
    -   Emergency stop logic in the behavior tree.
-   **Hardware Safety (for a real robot):**
    -   Physical E-stop button.
    -   Safety enclosures (if not collaborative).
    -   Safety sensors (e.g., LIDAR for human detection, force sensors in gripper).
    -   Proper fusing and wiring for the power system.

### Step 3: Define Emergency Procedures

-   What happens if an E-stop is pressed?
-   What is the robot's safe state if it detects an unknown object in its immediate path?

  Safety is not a feature you add at the end; it must be designed into the system from the very beginning and continually re-evaluated throughout the robot's lifecycle.

## Challenges

1.  **Ethical Dilemmas in Safety:** Research the "Trolley Problem" in the context of autonomous vehicles. How do ethical frameworks like utilitarianism or deontology apply to robot decision-making in safety-critical situations?
2.  **Safety Sensor Technologies:** Research advanced safety sensor technologies used in industrial robotics (e.g., safety laser scanners, pressure-sensitive floor mats, vision-based safety monitoring systems).
3.  **Human Factors:** How do human factors (e.g., fatigue, distraction, over-reliance on automation) influence the design of safe human-robot collaborative systems?
