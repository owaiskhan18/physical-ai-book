# Checklist: Building "The Physical AI Handbook"

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step checklist for executing the development plan. It is designed for practical execution to build the Docusaurus site and develop the initial content.

---

## 1. Docusaurus Setup Tasks

- [ ] **1.1. Verify Prerequisites**
    - [ ] Confirm Node.js version 18.0 or higher is installed (`node -v`).
- [ ] **1.2. Initialize Project**
    - [ ] In the project root, run `npx create-docusaurus@latest handbook-site classic`.
    - [ ] Navigate into the newly created directory: `cd handbook-site`.
- [ ] **1.3. Configure `docusaurus.config.js`**
    - [ ] Open `handbook-site/docusaurus.config.js`.
    - [ ] Set `title` to "The Physical AI Handbook".
    - [ ] Set `tagline` to "From Pixels to Pliers: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Devices".
    - [ ] Update `url`, `organizationName`, and `projectName` with the correct project details.
    - [ ] Set `routeBasePath` in the `docs` preset to `/` to serve docs from the root.
    - [ ] Set `blog` in the `presets` to `false`.
    - [ ] Configure the `navbar` and `footer` in the `themeConfig` section.
- [ ] **1.4. Configure `sidebars.js`**
    - [ ] Open `handbook-site/sidebars.js`.
    - [ ] Replace its content with `export default { tutorialSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}] };` to enable file-based sidebar generation.
- [ ] **1.5. Clean Up Default Content**
    - [ ] Delete the `blog` directory.
    - [ ] Delete `src/pages/markdown-page.md`.
    - [ ] Delete the default `docs` directory and its contents.
    - [ ] Re-create an empty `docs` directory.
- [ ] **1.6. Verify Setup**
    - [ ] Run `npm run start` from within the `handbook-site` directory.
    - [ ] Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser to confirm the clean, empty site is running.

## 2. Chapter 1 Development Tasks

This section covers the end-to-end creation of Chapter 1 and its three lessons.

- [ ] **2.1. Initial Chapter Setup**
    - [ ] Create the chapter directory: `handbook-site/docs/chapter-1`.
    - [ ] Create the category file: `handbook-site/docs/chapter-1/_category_.json`.
    - [ ] Add the following content to `_category_.json` to name the chapter in the sidebar:
      ```json
      {
        "label": "Chapter 1: The Spark of Life",
        "position": 1
      }
      ```
    - [ ] Create the asset directory: `handbook-site/static/img/chapter-1`.

### 2.2. Lesson 1.1: Your First Circuit - Blinking an LED

- [ ] **Planning & Drafting**
    - [ ] Create a detailed outline for the lesson's flow and learning objectives.
    - [ ] Write the first draft of the lesson content in a new file: `docs/chapter-1/lesson-1-1-blinking-an-led.mdx`.
- [ ] **Asset Creation**
    - [ ] Create the asset subdirectory: `static/img/chapter-1/lesson-1-1`.
    - [ ] Create a clean Fritzing diagram of the LED circuit. Save as `wiring-diagram.png` in the asset subdirectory.
    - [ ] Record a GIF of the final blinking LED project. Save as `final-result.gif` in the asset subdirectory.
- [ ] **Review & Validation**
    - [ ] **Technical Review:** Have a reviewer build the circuit and run the code *only* using the draft document.
    - [ ] **Editorial Review:** Proofread the document for tone, grammar, and clarity.
- [ ] **Integration**
    - [ ] Incorporate all review feedback into the `.mdx` file.
    - [ ] Embed the wiring diagram and result GIF into the document.
    - [ ] Apply Docusaurus admonitions (e.g., `::tip`, `::warning`) where appropriate.

### 2.3. Lesson 1.2: Sensing the World - Reading a Light Sensor

- [ ] **Planning & Drafting**
    - [ ] Create a detailed outline for the lesson.
    - [ ] Write the first draft of the content in `docs/chapter-1/lesson-1-2-reading-a-sensor.mdx`.
- [ ] **Asset Creation**
    - [ ] Create the asset subdirectory: `static/img/chapter-1/lesson-1-2`.
    - [ ] Create a Fritzing diagram for the photoresistor circuit. Save as `wiring-diagram.png`.
    - [ ] Record a GIF showing the Serial Monitor output changing as light levels change. Save as `final-result.gif`.
- [ ] **Review & Validation**
    - [ ] **Technical Review:** Build the physical project and validate the code from the draft.
    - [ ] **Editorial Review:** Proofread for quality and consistency.
- [ ] **Integration**
    - [ ] Incorporate feedback and embed all assets into the final `.mdx` file.

### 2.4. Lesson 1.3: Creating a Reaction - The Automatic Night-Light

- [ ] **Planning & Drafting**
    - [ ] Create a detailed outline for the lesson.
    - [ ] Write the first draft of the content in `docs/chapter-1/lesson-1-3-automatic-night-light.mdx`.
- [ ] **Asset Creation**
    - [ ] Create the asset subdirectory: `static/img/chapter-1/lesson-1-3`.
    - [ ] Create a Fritzing diagram for the combined LED and photoresistor circuit. Save as `wiring-diagram.png`.
    - [ ] Record a GIF demonstrating the final project (LED turning on in the dark). Save as `final-result.gif`.
- [ ] **Review & Validation**
    - [ ] **Technical Review:** Build the physical project and validate the code from the draft.
    - [ ] **Editorial Review:** Proofread for quality and consistency.
- [ ] **Integration**
